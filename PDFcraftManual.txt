ÅyPDF Processing Tool - User ManualÅz

This tool, ÅgPDFcraft,Åh allows you to perform tasks such as splitting, merging, and converting PDF files to Word format.
To use it, drop files into CommandMaker (the launch window), choose the desired operation, and run it.
If you want to repeat the same operation, it's convenient to edit the generated commands.txt and drop it into CommandMaker.
You can also use variables for parts of the command.

Å° Supported Operations and Commands

merge
Merges multiple PDF files.
merge(["input1.pdf", "input2.pdf"], "output.pdf")

split
Splits a PDF into two parts at a specified page.
split("input.pdf", 3, "part1.pdf", "part2.pdf")

replace
Replaces a range of pages with another PDF.
replace("base.pdf", 2, 4, "new.pdf", "output.pdf")

remove
Removes a specified range of pages.
remove("input.pdf", 2, 3, "output.pdf")

extract
Extracts a specified range of pages.
extract("input.pdf", 2, 5, "output.pdf")

convert
Converts a PDF to Word format.
convert("input.pdf", "output.docx")

watermark
Overlays watermark text repeatedly on a PDF.
watermark(["input.pdf"], "Confidential", ["output.pdf"])

sukashi
Copies elements from the first page of a PowerPoint file to all pages up to a specified page, and saves it as a PDF.
sukashi("input.pptx", 5, ["Watermark"], ["TotalPages"], "output.pdf")

Note:
Before using this feature, place text boxes named ÅgWatermarkÅh and ÅgTotalPagesÅh on the first page of the PowerPoint file.

ÅgWatermarkÅh will be copied to all pages (e.g., background text like ÅgConfidentialÅh).

ÅgTotalPagesÅh will be automatically overwritten with Åg/ Total Page CountÅh format (e.g., Åg/ 5Åh).

add
Adds image files (JPEG, etc.) to a PDF and saves it. The original PDF will be renamed with the date.
add("input.pdf", ["img1.jpg", "img2.jpg"], "backup_input_240329.pdf")

Note:
This runs when only image files are present in the executableÅfs folder, and one PDF file is dropped into the window.

pdf
Converts multiple images into a single PDF.
pdf(["img1.jpg", "img2.jpg"], "output.pdf")

insert
Inserts another PDF before a specific page of a base PDF.
insert("base.pdf", 3, "insert.pdf", "output.pdf")

password
Adds a password to PDF files. Multiple files can be processed at once.
password(["input1.pdf", "input2.pdf"], "mypassword", ["output1.pdf", "output2.pdf"])

Å° Variable Definition and User Input Mechanism

By defining variables in the generated commands.txt,
you can perform reusable and generalized tasks repeatedly.
Use Åg?Åh to prompt the user with an input box or file selection dialog.

If the variable's description includes words like Ågpath,Åh Ågaddress,Åh or Ågfile,Åh
a file selection dialog will appear; otherwise, a text input box will open.

You can also write multiple commands.

Å° Example of commands.txt
# Variable Definitions
Base PDF File: x1 = ?
Insert PDF File: x2 = ?
Insert Page Number: insertpage = 3

# Operation
insert(x1, insertpage, x2)

Å° How to Execute Files

Write the desired commands in commands.txt as shown above.
Drop the target file (or folder) into the toolÅfs window.
The tool will automatically read commands.txt and execute the corresponding operations.

Å° Scheduled Execution (Advanced Feature)
at now + 2min do merge(["a.pdf", "b.pdf"], "out.pdf")
Å® Executes the command 2 minutes later.
